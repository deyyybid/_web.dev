###### :technologist: Self-Learner to Full Stack Developer
## Website Development Journey :globe_with_meridians:
#### Overview :telescope:
Embark on a comprehensive journey with me as I traverse the roadmap to becoming a full stack developer. Beginning with the bedrock of web development, I master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, laying the foundation for my coding prowess. I then delve into essential tools and technologies such as NPM and Git, honing my collaboration and version control skills. Harnessing the power of Tailwind CSS, I refine my styling capabilities, creating sleek and responsive user interfaces. Venturing into the realm of frontend frameworks, I embrace React, empowering myself to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

Transitioning to the backend, I explore the capabilities of Node.js, leveraging its versatility to craft robust server-side solutions. Diving into databases, I conquer PostgreSQL, mastering the art of data storage and retrieval. As I progress, I delve into RESTful APIs and JWT authentication, learning to architect secure and scalable backend systems.

Equipped with a solid foundation, I broaden my horizons to encompass essential infrastructure technologies, delving into Linux basics and familiarizing myself with AWS services like Route53, SES, EC2, VPC, and S3. I optimize system performance and reliability with tools like Monit and GitHub Actions, automating tasks and ensuring seamless deployment workflows.

Continuing my journey, I embrace configuration management tools like Ansible and infrastructure as code with Terraform, empowering myself to orchestrate and manage complex cloud environments with ease.

Join me as I navigate this multifaceted roadmap, embracing challenges, celebrating milestones, and evolving into a proficient full stack developer ready to tackle the demands of modern web development.

### Self Reminder :pushpin:
10 years from now you will surely become someone, the big question is who?
- What would you like to have?
- Where do you want to go?
- How much would you like to earn?

These are some major question to ask.

If you go to work on it now.

Sure enough in a very short period of time you can take on a new direction to be the kind of person you want to be.
